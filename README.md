# Machine-learning-and-or-data-mining-exercise
The aim of this coursework is to critically analyse data sources and data sets, critically evaluate possible data analytics, mining and modelling challenges and solutions, conduct research into relevant academic literature in the subject area, choose, design and implement machine learning and data mining algorithms to the chosen data, and apply the chosen techniques to a specific case study with a defined research question.

This coursework is an requiring the application of one or more machine learning approaches on a recommended (and agreed with the module coordinator) dataset (either publicly available or recommended for use under NDA with UoB research unit or partner), including data description, analysis, a brief overview of relevant current research sources, description of (for example) the practical development of models, rule mining process(es), learning results (or similar), analysis of results with potential updates and variants, discussion and conclusions.
